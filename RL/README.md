# Marvel Snap Agent
Marvel Snap belongs to the strategy card game genre. This genre presents several unqiue challenges when trying to train an agent to perform well at the game. Firstly, the game is an imperfect information game. You do not know which cards your opponent has on their hand, let alone in their deck (although human players can often infer this after seeing some cards, this is another challenging thing to learn). The game also consists of two non-trivial stages, namely the **Deck-Building stage** and the **Battle stage** [^1].
